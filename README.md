## 1. Introduction
 Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a transformative technology that converts images of text into machine-readable text. This project uses Google's ML Kit to implement OCR on mobile platforms, allowing real-time text detection from documents, signs, and handwritten notes.
## 2. Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build an efficient and accurate OCR system using ML Kit that can: 
- Extract text from images in real-time 
- Recognize handwritten and printed characters 
- Work seamlessly on Android devices
## 3. Tools & Technologies
- Google ML Kit (Text Recognition API) 
-  Android Studio (Java/Kotlin) 
-  Git/GitHub (for version control)
## 4. Methodology
 The following steps will be followed: 
 1. Image acquisition via camera or gallery
 2. Preprocessing image (grayscale, binarization)
 3. Text recognition using ML Kit’s on-device API
 4. Displaying and exporting recognized text
## 5. Key Features
- Offline Text Recognition
- Real-Time Detection
- Multi-language Support
- Easy-to-use Interface
## 6. Expected Outcomes
We aim to deliver a fully functional mobile OCR application that offers:
- Accurate text extraction from images 
- Support for various fonts and handwriting styles 
- High performance with minimal latency
## 7. Conclusion
This OCR project utilizing ML Kit holds immense potential in simplifying data entry, document scanning, and accessibility applications. By leveraging machine learning on mobile, we aim to create a lightweight yet powerful tool for text recognition.

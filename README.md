# ScanShot - OCR & Image Analysis App

## 1. Introduction
**ScanShot** is a feature-rich mobile application designed for fast and accurate text and object recognition. Powered by Google ML Kit, it leverages on-device machine learning to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR), Object Detection, Barcode Scanning, and OMR (Optical Mark Recognition) without requiring an internet connection. The app enables users to easily scan text, detect objects, evaluate MCQ answer sheets, and decode QR/barcodes from images or real-time camera input.

## 2. Objective
The primary objective of **ScanShot** is to build a powerful, lightweight mobile app that can:
- Extract text from images and live camera input
- Recognize objects and label them in real-time
- Automatically check multiple-choice answer sheets using OMR
- Decode barcodes and QR codes
- Provide all features in an offline, on-device environment

## 3. Tools & Technologies
- **Google ML Kit**
  - Text Recognition (on-device)
  - Image Labeling
  - Object Detection and Tracking
  - Barcode Scanning
- **Android Studio** (Kotlin)
- **CameraX** (for live camera integration)
- **uCrop** (for cropping selected or captured images)
- **OpenCV** (for OMR sheet detection and comparison)
- **Git/GitHub** (for version control and collaboration)

## 4. Methodology
The app follows a modular and efficient pipeline:
1. **Image Input**: Capture image via camera or pick from gallery
2. **Image Preprocessing**: Crop or enhance images as needed
3. **ML Task Execution**:
   - OCR: Detect and extract text using ML Kit
   - Object Detection: Label objects using real-time camera feed
   - OMR: Compare answer sheets against the correct key
   - Barcode Scanning: Detect QR/barcodes from images or live feed
4. **Result Display**: Visualize results with intuitive UI and annotated feedback

## 5. Key Features
